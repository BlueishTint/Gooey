# Gooey 1.0.9 Released! 

### Warning: **Upgrade with caution!** 1.0.9 removes the experimental Dynamic Updates feature and replaces it with a _new_ experimental Dynamic Updates feature! The two APIs are incompatible.    

TODO: make sure all Config objects get the same updates you made to the main one!  
TODO: update the new tests to check both ArgumentParser and GooeyParser! 
TODO: rewx: document how to make your own controlled component from an exisitng wx one 
TODO: rewx: document toubleshoot for when custom controlled component has its children disappear (i.e. add "self_managed=True)
New: 

 - graceful shutdown 
 - dynamic updates and validation! 
 
 Upgrade with caution. Numerous changes. 
 
 - no longer modifies sys.argv and instead modifies parser at runtime to consume the extra cli flag.
 
 - fixed visual bug where displaying errors could cause widgets on the same row to go out of alignment.
